# About
This project is a fullstack app,  
the frontend was made using Vite and React,  
and the backend was made using NodeJS and Express.  
I made this to try and build a competent site while pushing my skills forward.  
  
On the site, you're able to log in with an account, look for products, add products to cart and more.  
You can access it here: https://untitledcamp.netlify.app/  
  
The API is able to register accounts and create and retrieve products.  
You can access it here: https://untitle-camp.herokuapp.com/api/<desired route>
